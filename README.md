# landing-page
Based on The Odin Project's assignment at the following link:
https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page

This project's intention is to be a close replica to Odin's sample landing page provided in the lesson, which can be found here:

Some marginal changes were made, such as subtle spacing differences, but overall is designed to be faithful to the landing page they provided. This is to test my ability to copy a webpage as closely as possible from scratch.

My personal take on the Landing Page Project will be represented in a seperate repository, and will be linked below when it is completed.
